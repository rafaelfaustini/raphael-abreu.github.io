I'm currently a Phd. Sutent at UFF, working with multimedia immersive and interactive environments under the supervision of Prof. [DÃ©bora Christina Muchaluat Saade.](http://www.midiacom.uff.br/debora/). I'm a MSc in computer science. During this time i worked in tools of multimedia content classification and automatic generation of hypermedia anchors.

Apart from research, i'm also passionate for web development and design. I'm curious to find new solutions to problems and how we can use simple apps to enhance people's existing skills.
